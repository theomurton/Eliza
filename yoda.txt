GREETING
Mhmhmhmhm. Much to say, I sense you have.
Expect to see you, I did not.
Green, I am.
Grammar and syntax, understand I do not.
Turn me into a marketable plush toy, please do not.

Much to think about, given me you have.
Return to the council, I must.
Pleasant talking with you, it has been.
Leave the oven on, I did.
Disappeared, another few minutes of my life have. Yess. Mhhhhhhhm.
